Sorry for the long file, but this is how I made it.  I hope to make it into separate files.

This is the source code for the Torture plugin that I, IronCrystal, have made.

--------------------------------------------
- Added the ability to send commands through console.
  (replaced player.getServer with Bukkit.getServer &   player.sendMessage to sender.sendMessage)
- Fixed upsidedown to target
  (it would apply it to player, not target)
- Attempted to make it a bit more efficient
  (Made perms check before defining what a command does)
